# Multifaceted-Alphabet-Blocks
You are constructing a set of N alphabet blocks. The first block has 1 face. The second block has 2 faces, and so on up to the Nth block, which has N faces. Each face contains a letter. Given a word list, return a set of blocks that can spell every word on the word list, making N as small as possible. A word can be spelled with the blocks if you can take some subset of the blocks, take one face from each block you chose, put them in some order, and spell the word.
